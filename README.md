# Get the hack out!
As a team of two – the Hacker and the "guy in a chair" – steal the data from the evil facility at get out safely.

Hacker is deployed on the top of the building and needs to get to the computer in the basement. On their way down guards await. That is where the "guy in a chair" comes in. While the Hackers vision is limited, the guy has plans of every floor of the entire building and positions of the guards. Using only voice communication try to collect the data.

If you thought the way down would be hard, you will be scared of what the way up will look like. As the hacker gets into the main frame sucessfully, the alarms go of in the entire building. Everything is happening faster now! Will you keep up with the tempo and be able to get out in one piece? Will you be able survive the tension and overcome stress, or will your communication become chaotic and the Hacker will have to improvise?
